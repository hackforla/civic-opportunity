# Project title and description

Hack For LA brings together civic-minded technologists to build digital products, programs and services with community partners and local government to address issues in the LA region. This is done by using the web as a platform for local government and community service. 

The Civic Opportunity Project will seek to provide a curated journey for candidates to serve in the Civic space in the form of technology. The program goal is to equip the participants with the proper resources, exposure and toolsets to excel in the competitive workforce. The Civic Opportunity Project will continuously iterate the experience process and ultimately exist as a software product that can be streamlined and replicated.

# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team {on Slack/at our weekly hack night/etc}.
- To help with user research, {do ABC}.
- To provide design support, {do XYZ}.
- To contribute to the code, follow the instructions below.

Remember to provide direct links to each channel.



## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues

- Explain how to submit a bug.
- Explain how to submit a feature request.
- Explain how to contribute to an existing issue.

To create a new issue, please use the blank issue template (available when you click New Issue).  If you want to create an issue for other projects to use, please create the issue in your own repository and send a slack message to one of your hack night hosts with the link.
